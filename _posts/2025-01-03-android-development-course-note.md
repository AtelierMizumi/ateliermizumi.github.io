# Simplified guide on taking snapshots on Btrfs with btrfs-assistant

Are you a Linux user who frequently modifies system configurations but worries about potential system failures? System snapshots offer a reliable safety net, allowing you to restore your system if something goes wrong.

While Snapper is a powerful tool for managing Btrfs snapshots, it requires configuration file editing that some users find challenging. This guide introduces btrfs-assistant, a user-friendly graphical tool that simplifies the snapshot management process on Btrfs filesystems.

## Installation

### Arch

Btrfs Assistant can be installed from the AUR as `btrfs-assistant`

### Debian

There are unofficial Debian packages [here](https://software.opensuse.org/download/package?package=btrfs-assistant&project=home:iDesmI:more) coutesy of [@idesmi](https://gitlab.com/idesmi) or you can follow the instructions for Ubuntu to build it yourself.

### Ubuntu

Install Snapper package using this command:

```bash
sudo apt install snapper
```

### Fedora

Btrfs Assistant is available in the Fedora repos as `btrfs-assistant`

## Btrfs Assistant

## Configure snapshot through btrfs-assistant

Head over to Snapper setting tab (if you dont see it, install `snapper` package), enter config name, select **subvolume** to back up and choose needed systemd settings and press **Save**. Now  **Timely snapshot** interval settings will pop-up.
I want to select the snapshot on boot with grub and clean old snapshots to save up space. This is my config to back up `/home` subvolume

This setting will take one snapshot every day.

Btrfs Assistant also allows you to take manual snapshot and manage your snapshots easier

My Arch installation using `archinstall` script using Btrfs with LUKS encryption has created the `/.snapshots` directory already but I can't seems to add my own configuration on it so we need a little tweak to get it working us way

Unmount the subvolume and remove the mountpoint ... (yes you can use `rm -rf` to remove subvolumes)

```bash
sudo umount /.snapshots
sudo rm -rf /.snapshots
```

## Use grub-btrfs to boot from snapshots

### Note

>Snapper's snapshots are read-only, and there are some inherent difficulties booting into read-only snapshots. Many services, such as a desktop manager, require a writable /var directory, and will fail to start when booted from a read-only snapshot.
>
>To work around this, you can either make the snapshots writable, or use the developer-approved method of booting the snapshots with overlayfs, causing the snapshot to behave similar to a live CD environment. 

## To boot snapshots with overlayfs

- Ensure [grub-btrfs](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=grub-btrfs) is installed on your system.
- Add `grub-btrfs-overlayfs` to the end of the HOOKS array in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`. For example:

```conf
HOOKS=(base udev autodetect microcode modconf kms keyboard keymap consolefont block filesystems fsck grub-btrfs-overlayfs)
```

- [Regerate the initramfs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Regenerate_the_initramfs).

```bash
sudo mkinitcpio -P
```

- Set the location of the directory containing the `grub.cfg` file in `/etc/default/grub-btrfs/config`.

Example: EndeavousOS's `grub.cfg` is located in `/efi/grub` and my Arch Linux's is in `/boot/grub`

```conf
GRUB_BTRFS_GRUB_DIRNAME="/boot/grub"
```

## Auto-update GRUB

Enable `grub-btrfs.path` to auto-regenerate `grub-btrfs.cfg` whenever a modification appears in `/.snapshots` ...

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now grub-btrfs.path
```

More info check out [grub-btrfs](https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs)

## System rollback the 'Arch Way'

Snapper includes a rollback tool, but on Arch systems the preferred method is a manual rollback.

After booting into a snapshot mounted **rw** courtesy of **overlayfs**, mount the toplevel subvolume (subvolid=5). That is, omit any subvolid or subvol mount flags (example: an encrypted device map labelled **cryptdev**) ...

```bash
sudo mount /dev/mapper/cryptdev /mnt
```

Move the broken `@` subvolume out of the way ...

```bash
sudo mv /mnt/@ /mnt/@.broken
```
Or simply delete the subvolume ...

```bash
sudo btrfs subvolume delete /mnt/@
```
Find the number of the snapshot that you want to recover ...

```bash
sudo grep -r '<date>' /mnt/@snapshots/*/info.xml
[...]
/.snapshots/8/info.xml:  <date>2022-08-20 15:21:53</date>
/.snapshots/9/info.xml:  <date>2022-08-20 15:22:39</date>
```
Create a read-write snapshot of the read-only snapshot taken by Snapper ...

```bash
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/@snapshots/number/snapshot /mnt/@
```
Where **number** is the snapshot you wish to restore as the new **@**.

Unmount **/mnt**.

Reboot and rollback!
